# Golf Course Review

## Getting Started:

[Get Reviewing](https://golf-course-review.herokuapp.com/)

I really enjoying golfing and have recently convinced a lot of my friends to join in on the fun.  There are a lot of golf courses in our area and an application that would succinctly give me all the necessary information and also reviews from previous patrons.  There is always the possibility that a course has changed prices, gone through a renovation, or possibly had conditions worsen.  It would be great to have this information readily available.
